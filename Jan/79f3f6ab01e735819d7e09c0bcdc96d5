A good week In a blow against the peddling of political slurs and disinformation, veteran journalists Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki and Anton Harber took the EFF to court and won. They wanted the EFF to prove or withdraw the claim that they were agents of Stratcom, an apartheid-era propaganda unit. In the Joburg high court, judge Lebogang Modiba found the EFF could not prove the allegation and ordered the party to unconditionally retract it and apologise — and pay R40,000 to each applicant, plus their costs. An important victory. A bad week "This victory is temporary. God/The Universe is on the side of the truth … even if it takes 20 years." Zindzi Mandela’s tweet in reaction to the Harber/Gqubule-Mbeki court victory over the EFF’s claim that they were agents (an allegation first made by Winnie Madikizela-Mandela 20 years ago), is of a piece with her rant on the land question last year. SA’s ambassador to Denmark seems to have a penchant for sowing division, undermining the law and playing into the hands of populists. Not what you want of a diplomat.
