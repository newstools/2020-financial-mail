This is an open letter to all politicians and all those in executive positions in government. My fellow South Africans, as soon as you can find some quiet time away from your busy schedules please do the following. Get Wikipedia on your laptop screen and in the search bar, type exactly the following: "Greek government-debt crisis". Ensure that you get this specific article on your screen. Read it and download the PDF version so that you can reread it later and send it to other people. What you will read is a mild version of what could be in store for SA. And it is fast becoming inevitable. While reading the article, keep in mind that SA, unlike Greece, which is a member of the EU, does not have wealthy big brothers in the form of the European Central Bank, the European Commission or the European Investment Bank to bail it out of its financial troubles. We stand alone in this developing mess. Also keep in mind that South Africans tend to be violent, intolerant, racially polarised and economically illiterate, which means that our country can literally go up in flames when the proverbial pawpaw hits the fan. If you care about this country, if you care about your fellow citizens, if you care about our children, if you care about your pensions, let this Wikipedia article be a personal wake-up call. It is not too late to avoid this looming catastrophe, but the longer we wait to take drastic steps to do so, the more difficult it will become.
