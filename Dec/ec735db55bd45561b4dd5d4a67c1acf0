It is with great astonishment that I read that Delta’s valuers did not account for commissions and property management fees. I am dumbfounded that the "professional" property valuers (all five of them) did not pick up on this rather obvious mistake. As a result, investment properties were overstated by R1.9bn. Property valuations are the most material item on a property company’s financials, so you would expect the auditors to rigorously audit these valuations. Once again SA’s investors have been cheated by auditors and other professionals, who were caught sleeping at the wheel. Name withheld The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
