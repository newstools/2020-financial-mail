The SA National Roads Agency may be celebrating the fact that it won its Mtentu bridge force majeure appeal case relating to the joint venture contractors leaving the site after receiving threats. But the outcome of the case will do immense harm to the already devastated construction industry, and no foreign experts will contemplate a future joint venture in SA. President Cyril Ramaphosa and his lackeys use the media to issue a "stern warning" to those business forums that disrupt construction sites, but the reality is that these actions will continue unabated and his requests for investment pledges will fall on deaf ears. Every day we see examples of complete disdain for law and order, and one wonders why we still need a police force — it is completely ineffective and, sadly, many in top management are tainted by allegations of corruption.
