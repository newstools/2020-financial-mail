A good week Receiving the first coronavirus vaccine in the US must have been a huge relief for Sandra Lindsay — the 52-year-old critical care nurse who directs an intensive care unit at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, caring for Covid patients. Her jab presumably kicks off a plan to halt the virus in a country that has already lost over 300,000 citizens to the rampaging disease. That’s more than the number of people who died in World War 2, and it means Covid-19 has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death in the US. A bad week Oh dear. It turns out chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng is as susceptible to disinformation around Covid as everyone else. But while believing that the Covid-19 vaccine may be infused with the biblical mark of the beast would be cause for anyone to check their meds, it’s a far more dangerous prospect that the head of the judiciary is spending his time weighing this as a serious consideration. Fingers crossed that no-one takes any vaccine denial case to the Constitutional Court during his last year in office.
