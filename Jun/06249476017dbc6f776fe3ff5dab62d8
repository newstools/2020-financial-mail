If Charles Shields is so certain about the standing of his gallery, why has he written such a vitriolic letter disputing an article that largely states globally recognised truths about the art world? Does he dispute that New York is the world’s most important capital, and global recovery of the art world will be measured there? Or that the income of galleries, especially smaller ones, depends on art fairs or international collectors? Shields is only concerned with one paragraph in which it is made clear his gallery is not a first-tier one. This has implications for the pricing of some of its art. So he needs to undermine my work and latest publication on the SA art market to detract from this finding. Everard Read has many galleries and represents the largest number of artists, yet in my article I had to lump it in with other galleries. This was due to the brevity of the article. Indeed, Everard Read does have a London gallery and Shields confirms my suggestion that this will keep it connected to international collectors. I apologise for not stating this. However, its London gallery has not altered its status in the global art market — this has to do not only with its fair participation, but the absence of "superstar" artists in its stable. This isn’t my criterion; it is one the art world has set — I have simply concretised and applied it to the local context. Mary CorrigallCape Town The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
