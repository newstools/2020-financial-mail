I agree with Prof Glenda Gray’s comments about the lockdown. I was glad when our politicians decided their decisions would be science-based; I hoped this would mean some logic in their decisions. But I seem to have been wrong. For example, the biggest factor in controlling Covid-19 is the R0 number. If it’s above 1, the spread of infection is getting worse; less and it is decreasing. We don’t get given weekly R0 values, so have no knowledge of where we are. When the government admits to not revealing everything to avoid panic, it is time to be alarmed. Clearly, the infection is spreading. And we’ve been told that testing is way behind — so all our quoted figures are nonsense. Yet the lockdown is being eased. Explain that logic! And this applies to all areas — including the hotspots. The politicians are clearly in charge, not science. We will be in the grip of this epidemic for a long time.
