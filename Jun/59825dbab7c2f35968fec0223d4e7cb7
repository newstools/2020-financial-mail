As citizens, we should be extremely worried about the debacle between the health ministry and the SA Medical Research Council over the issue of Prof Glenda Gray. The saga began when Gray said the government’s lockdown approach was "unscientific" and that regulations were a thumb-suck. Compounding matters were utterances attributed to Gray about increasing malnutrition cases among children at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital. Subsequently, there were calls from both the board of the council and the ministry that she must be investigated and sanctioned. Then the council retracted its statement, saying the matter must be resolved by the ministry and Gray. Our apprehensions are justified if the people entrusted with our safety aren’t singing from the same hymn book. We need to be assured by our leaders that they are working in tandem, and that the messages they send are clear and informed by science and empirical data. This will ensure that we win the war and flatten the Covid curve. Mafika Siphiwe MgcinaANC Sedibeng task team (writing in his personal capacity) The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
