Talk about a quick response! Event and bespoke gatherings company Vula Afrika has just launched a virtual events service to tackle our new world of online conferences, presentations, entertainment and family get-togethers. Basically, it is aiming to make your next Zoom or Microsoft Teams meeting about a million times nicer. For businesses, it has virtual day conference packages that include a smorgasbord of brain food, technical support, branded packaging, headphones and eco-stationery as part an extensive menu. Delivering these to clients, and potential clients that you are wooing, seems an especially savvy move. Then it is also doing a personalised virtual birthday party and special occasion offering. The service is currently available in Joburg and Cape Town, and 7% of each order is donated to the Black Cellar Clubâ€™s education fund. For more info visit vulaafrika.com
