Lisa Steyn’s piece (Features, May 21-27) read as if it had been written in the early 1980s, when renewables were in their infancy. There is one passing reference to environmental, social and governance criteria, and no mention of the sector that has to drive energy-source development if we are to stop the rise to 2°C global warming: renewables. I appreciate that the article is about oil and gas, but it beggars belief that SA is even thinking about vast new fossil fuel ventures when all research & development investment should be going into renewable power sources. In "Golden Gas Opportunity", Stephen Larkin is quoted as saying the new and repurposed gas sources can "give more power than Medupi running at full capacity, in just 18 months, at an eighth of the cost". Wouldn’t renewables be able to do that even more cheaply? Just how serious we are about reducing emissions — if these oil and gas projects do go ahead — will be seen in whether the carbon-capture provisions are enough to offset the emissions.
