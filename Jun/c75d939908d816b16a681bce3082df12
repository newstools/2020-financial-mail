The country’s first live-streamed mass Covid-19 gig is set to take place on Saturday and Sunday, June 6 and 7, from a helipad in Sandton. With more than 30 DJs on board, the event will be streamed, with spectacular panoramic skyline views, from Saturday at 3pm to midnight Sunday, at R50 a ticket. Helivation is the brainchild of live-streaming pioneer SkyRoomLive and events management company Joburg Life. Deelan Moodaley, owner of Joburg Life, normally employs 15 to 20 DJs on a weekend through one of the events he holds through Joburg Life, but that ended with the lockdown. Likewise, the various nightclubs he manages shut their doors. Moodaley says it was time to reinvent what they do, so they put together an event that could be allowed when the lockdown regulations eased. With strict health and safety measures in place, the festival will have no people present, apart from the artists and production crews. There will be a drone flying over Sandton, laser lights and a wide range of music. Those set to play include DJ Fresh, Euphonik, Cinimin, Ayanda MVP, DJ Dimplez, Abby Nurock, DJ Venom, DJ Speedsta, DJ Shimza and DJ Buhle. Because of the safety, health and sanitisation concerns they can’t reveal the actual address of the venue, but it is in the Sandton central zone. Below the helipad they’re performing on is a penthouse where interviews will take place with the artists. These will be aired on SkyRoomLive. And they’re not taking any health risks — they’re social distancing to the max and the DJ deck will be fastidiously sanitised. The event is also being advertised internationally, and at the equivalent of less than $3 or about £2.30 a ticket, it makes it pretty accessible. A percentage of the money raised through ticket sales will be used to help entertainment crews who’ve lost income because of the pandemic. Book tickets at skyroomlive.com
