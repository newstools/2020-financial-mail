"Red Lights Flashing" (Fox, October 22-28), which addresses concerns about the increasing compliance burden of a JSE listing, links to a column in a previous edition by Bernard Agulhas, "When Governance Goes Awry" (On My Mind, October 8-14), which addressed failures in the auditing industry. The JSE has an obligation to protect and assure the quality and integrity of its listings. The audit industry, in turn, talks of the conflict of interest created by needing to provide a form of oversight over the very customer whose custom, including the more lucrative consulting work, they would like to retain. This may be a naive suggestion, but surely a standard amount, calculated on standard metrics for each listed entity, should be ring-fenced for payment to the JSE. That organisation, in turn, would then be responsible for contracting the audit firms, on a rotating basis, to undertake audits of listed companies. It would narrow one of the largest holes through which corporate malfeasance may have snuck, and avoid conflict of interest for listed companies and audit firms alike.
