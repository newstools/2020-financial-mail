SA’s economy is in the doldrums, and something urgent must be done to take the country out of this economic crisis. President Cyril Ramaphosa has unveiled his much-awaited economic recovery plan. Among the key pillars of the plan is the rehashing of economic strategies from previous policy document such as the reconstruction & development plan, growth, employment & redistribution plan, accelerated & shared growth initiative for SA and the national development plan. All these plans have some common denominators: roll out huge infrastructure projects; deal with energy security; have reliable, efficient, accessible transport; put in place expanded public works programmes; rationalise state-owned enterprises; promote and buy local; and ensure food security. The missing link is our inability as a country to do assessment and introspection where we have failed, and to determine where the bottlenecks and impediments are that stifle full implementation. We always believe that unveiling and introducing a new economic policy will deal with the elephants in the room: low economic growth; huge unemployment; inequality; and poverty. We need to confront our demon, which is the lack of political will to deal with difficult issues, along with our inability to implement projects and set achievable and attainable timeframes on our plans and strategies. Ramaphosa must now look at his executive team, and ask it is fit for purpose and capable of delivering on this mammoth task. It’s time for him to lead from the front to implement the plan so that it translates it into economic growth and job creation, and lessens inequality and poverty.
