Taking three years to build a case of insider trading against former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste can only be described as "useless" on the part of the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (Features, November 5-11). How hard can it be to prove Jooste sent an SMS with insider information to friends and that they traded on that information? On a related note: the National Prosecuting Authority and others must know that Jooste will come in on the offensive, getting the state to focus on disproving his version of events rather than the other way around. He will kill them with documentation. Finally, with reference to your question — what makes Steinhoff different from VBS? — what Jooste concocted was genius; VBS was plain, outright theft.
