Uncertainty continues to dog the sale of TikTok, the social media app owned by Chinese media company ByteDance, which has become a pawn in a geopolitical struggle between the US and China. US President Donald Trump ordered that the US arm of TikTok be sold in August, but China’s government has thrown a spanner in the works by designating some of TikTok’s key technologies subject to export controls.

In all, 5.2-million loans were made to companies with fewer than 500 employees. Reuters
