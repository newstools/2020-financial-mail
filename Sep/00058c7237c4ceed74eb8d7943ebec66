The story about Babelegi Workwear & Industrial Supplies supplying masks (Features, September 10-16) was very interesting, and once again highlighted the government’s penchant for rushing off to court — knowing that us stupid taxpayers will pick up the tab. Is it not time that in the instance of frivolous cases, costs get awarded against the particular government official who initiated the case? That would ensure that more thought went into a case before rushing into litigation. For a government that professes to encourage entrepreneurs (or is it only black businesses?) it does a good job of stifling small firms that probably employ a large proportion of black employees. It makes people wonder why they should take on the stress and financial pain of running their own business. President Cyril Ramaphosa must stop speaking with a forked tongue.
