We have gone over the edge; we are in the abyss. If we are ever going to have a chance of climbing out of the hole South Africans have dug for themselves, we need to focus on the real challenge that presents itself. That is not what the inconsequential musing of Chris Roper is in "Boxing Clever" (Features, August 20-26), in which he tries to compare the debate between the DA’s Mbali Ntuli and John Steenhuisen with the classic boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. "Boxing clever" would rather be to take a leaf out of the book of US presidential hopeful Joe Biden. At the recent Democratic Party convention he was supported by all his rivals for the party’s nomination as well as by some prominent disaffected Republicans. They all joined hands to overcome the biggest threat in the history of US democracy: Donald Trump. Instead of trying to divide the opposition, the FM should promote the narrative that SA’s opposition parties should unite to rid our country of the scourge of the ANC. I listen to SAfm every morning, and you would be amazed at how many angry ANC supporters there are who would vote for a united opposition with a coherent message. That message is well presented by Justice Malala (At Home and Abroad, August 20-26), who tells the tale of a president who is intent on saving a totally corrupt party from itself — but doesn’t seem to have a plan. We must have a plan, and the FM should articulate it. Paul McNaughtonStellenbosch The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
