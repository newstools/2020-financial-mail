1. Ice Age cave bear discovered intact Reindeer herders in Russia’s Lyakhovsky Islands in the Arctic have found the complete carcass of an Ice Age cave bear in melting permafrost. The remains have yet to be dated properly, but preliminary estimates put them at somewhere between 22,000 and 39,500 years old. It’s the first such find of its kind, The Guardian reports; scientists have previously found only the bones of cave bears. "It is completely preserved, with all internal organs in place, including even its nose," says Lena Grigorieva, of the North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk. "This find is of great importance for the whole world." 2. Sticky green fingers A strict coronavirus lockdown in the Philippines has sparked a craze for gardening as Filipinos hanker after greenery. But it’s also behind a surge in plant poaching as illegal traders dig up indigenous plants — many of them endangered — to satisfy the market, according to The Guardian. Authorities are reportedly increasing forest patrols, and have warned of a possible 12-year prison sentence for anyone caught in possession of critically endangered plants. 3. Fine face fashion At a time when fashion houses are bearing the brunt of a world turned to yoga pants, Louis Vuitton is looking to make inroads in the personal protective equipment market. Financial news site The Street reports that the luxury brand is launching a high-end face shield at the end of October. The product will reportedly come with "an elasticated monogrammed strap", golden studs and a visor that darkens in sunlight and can be flipped upwards like a peaked cap. All for just £750.
