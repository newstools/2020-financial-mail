1. Now China prepares tit-for-tat response to US The Chinese government has plans to release its own corporate blacklist, in a tit-for-tat response to the US, which has targeted some of its largest technology companies. Its so-called "unreliable entity list" is a document that intends to mirror a US list that restricts named companies from accessing items originating in the US. It is expected to name at least one US company in the next few months. The list was announced a day after the US said it would ban US transactions using Tencent-owned WeChat and video app TikTok. 2. Elephant deaths explained Toxins made by microscopic algae caused the previously unexplained deaths of elephants in Botswana, the country’s officials say. Elephant carcasses were first discovered in the Okavango delta in May. At least 330 are now known to have died from ingesting cyanobacteria, which can occur naturally in standing water and sometimes grow into large blooms known as blue-green algae. Until now authorities had doubted that the bacteria were to blame because the blooms appear on the edges of ponds and elephants tend to drink from the middle, according to AFP. The deaths stopped late in June, coinciding with the drying of water pans. 3. Probe into Rio Tinto An inquiry into Rio Tinto’s destruction of 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, an Aboriginal site in Western Australia, in May has heard that the company is expected to destroy another 124 heritage sites at a new iron ore development less than 100km away. Questions have also been raised about the approval granted by the government to destroy the sites at the gorge. It was done on the basis of ministerial consent that may have been invalid. That means the state could be liable for a compensation claim from the traditional owners of Juukan Gorge, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people.
