The last paragraph of Thuli Madonsela’s column (Protected Space, September 10-16), in which she poses the question, "Is the EFF unheard and disempowered?", is very relevant — perhaps more so than the EFF itself. The party’s stony silence and lack of action during the Covid pandemic seem to indicate it had nothing at all to contribute. Then came Tresemmé and Clicks — public violence and the destruction of property. We as citizens watched as police stood by and decided this was not a matter requiring any action. Rather apprehend a frightened old lady who pulled out her pistol after being harassed and manhandled by a few of these thugs. This latest action and the untouchable attitude of the EFF seems to indicate it is protected by a "third force". Has there ever been a conviction of an EFF member — despite allegations around tenders in Limpopo, VBS Mutual Bank, threats to burn a hospital, assault of journalists and discharging an assault rifle in public? To my knowledge, nothing at all. The question of the EFF’s relevance needs to be answered. Is it a political party that is contributing to democracy, or a sanctioned terrorist group shielded by the ANC? Are EFF members sent in to create chaos where the ANC dare not tread? It is time the ANC clarified this and answered the many questions being asked about the new democracy in SA. Or, as Madonsela said, is it time to reimagine our democracy before it is too late?
