Given his history, I often wonder whether transport minister Fikile Mbalula thinks before he opens his mouth. Mbalula, like many other politicians, thinks that a threatening and aggressive stance will pull the masses into line, when in fact the opposite applies. President Cyril Ramaphosa had the right idea at the start of the lockdown, and appealed to people’s sensible side. But Mbalula seems to thrive on shooting from the hip, which actually makes him a laughing stock. Given the illogical way the government thinks, I’m expecting there to be a ban on motor vehicles due to the high accident rate! How does anyone in government expect any sort of respect from the population if they conduct themselves the way they do? Respect is earned, not given.
