ANC indoctrinees were made to believe the struggle against apartheid was similar to a tennis match between Nelson Mandela and the apartheid government. The PAC, Azanian People’s Organisation, Black Sash and the like are conveniently dismissed as passengers of the ANC-driven (gravy) train. The case of former president Jacob Zuma being treated in a Russian health-care facility reminds me of the saying that Africa is a giant graveyard: its leaders are fond of getting get their health care elsewhere (which they deny their countrymen), and they return to Africa to be buried there. Andile Lungisa is therefore justified in being a snob who can’t be subjected to a subhuman abode called a prison. He was indoctrinated to think ANC membership means a crème de la crème status.
