1. Soak up the sun A Barcelona hospital is letting its Covid-19 patients out into the sun, partly in a bid to increase their vitamin D intake, after a Spanish study suggested it reduces intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. The study was published in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, and participants were divided into two groups. The control group received standard care and the second group were given vitamin D supplements. Half of the control group were admitted to ICU, and two died. However, in the vitamin D group, only one out of 50, or 2%, required ICU admission and no-one died. Earlier studies have disproved a link between vitamin D and better Covid outcomes. 2. Toe the party line German scientists believe Covid-19 may justify a three-year ban on house parties. Since lockdown restrictions have been lifted around the world, a spike in cases has been associated with gatherings and parties. They say gatherings will need to stop completely in order to lower infections. In the US, five students from the State University of New York organised a party that resulted in over 500 new cases just a few days later. In the UK, a resident was fined Â£10,000 after hosting a party of nearly 100 people. 3. Doctors on strike Nigerian doctors in state-run hospitals have begun an indefinite strike over pay, overcrowded facilities and a lack of personal protective equipment, AFP reports. The action by the National Association of Resident Doctors, which represents 40% of doctors, is the latest in a string of stoppages by medics to hit the country. Nigeria has over 40,000 resident doctors in state hospitals. Their other demands include life insurance coverage and payment of unsettled wages. Authorities fear a reduction in capacity could severely hamper its ability to tackle the pandemic as Covid-19 case numbers continue to rise.
