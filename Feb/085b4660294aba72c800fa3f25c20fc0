February 2 marked 30 years since then president FW de Klerk announced the unbanning of the ANC, PAC and SACP, and the release of Nelson Mandela. An atmosphere of euphoria swept across SA and the frontline states that housed thousands of our freedom fighters. They had sacrificed their childhoods, families and all other frills in their quest for our freedom. The announcement ushered in an era of hope, but also an era of misery for people living in townships and former bantustan villages. Violence was unleashed on our people by the state, agents provocateurs and the police force. Who can forget the violence on the Reef and many more areas in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal? Yet there was still optimism. The country was on the path of rebirth. We were excited that the “better life for all” would be achieved and that, with the ANC in control, we would achieve a united, democratic and prosperous SA. So let’s reflect on how we’ve fared since that watershed on February 2 1990. SA is ravaged by all sorts of social and economic crises. Violence against women and children is at its highest level, crime is rampant, and poverty, unemployment and inequality are at their worst levels. How did we arrive here? Why haven’t we made significant strides in addressing the challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality? Until we address the problems within the ANC of greed, gatekeeping, corruption, maladministration, careerism and poor governance, the optimism we held 30 years ago will be shattered; the dream deferred. This will spell disaster for our people. Their sacrifice in fighting the mighty apartheid machinery will have been in vain.
