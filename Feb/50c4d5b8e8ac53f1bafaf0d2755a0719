If President Cyril Ramaphosa is to reignite the hope that greeted his presidency, he must do three things at once. He must understand the anger, fear and hopes of South Africans; he must cut through the noise to identify the issues hindering our inclusive growth; and he must act swiftly and decisively to address them. This is no small ask, but there are three decisions he can make for immediate impact. First, affordable and reliable electricity supply is critical. Despite energy minister Gwede Mantashe’s December promise to introduce immediate measures to increase access to additional power, procurement from independent power producers (IPPs) remains elusive. By supporting IPPs, Ramaphosa can stabilise the nation’s power supply and chart a new course for future public-private partnerships across sectors to address our biggest challenges. Second, millions of South Africans are still desperately waiting for truly inclusive economic reforms. Ramaphosa has to prioritise reducing the red tape hampering small and medium-sized businesses, reduce the burden of compliance, and enact real incentives that promote inclusive growth. Finally, South Africans want an end to corruption. Neither the national psyche nor the fiscus can afford it. But without rapid action and consequences for beneficiaries of corruption, we are likely to see a further deterioration in our delicate social compact. Ramaphosa can harness the vigour of the new decade to his advantage — but he needs to act now. Adam CrakerIQbusiness, Joburg
