I am writing in the belief that the forces behind the "fight-back" campaign are loud and growing, and that unless South Africans show support for those fighting corruption, there will be a return to conditions that promote state capture. Your article on Pravin Gordhan, "A Marked Man" (Cover Story, February 13-19), reminded me of what most South Africans have known for a long time: Gordhan is one of the very few high-profile people standing up against state capture. It will be a disaster for the country if he is forced out of office. Most South Africans want to see change for the better. However, they are too caught up in daily life to be able to do anything significant to counter the loud and venal puppies hiding those who are against change. Unfortunately, this inaction encourages those who want to further corruption. The time is overdue for the population to show solidarity with those who are fighting corruption. This can be done in a completely apolitical way — you don’t need to be a supporter of any particular party; you simply need to be determined to see a better future for all South Africans. Those who support change for the better need actual, visible support. Perhaps a starting point — and an easy and inexpensive, but positive way of showing support — would be to encourage people to wear a badge with an inscription such as "Hands off Pravin Gordhan". Maybe some NGO would show an interest in starting a campaign in which the man on the street can participate. The time for talking is long past. Unless something positive is done now, we will be joining Zimbabwe in the abyss. James BurnsKnysna
