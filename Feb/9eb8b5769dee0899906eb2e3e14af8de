When I was a small boy, I used to pour drinks for my father’s colleagues — oil company executives — when they visited Mozambique to see how things were running. I was fortunate enough to spend a lot of time in their company, listening to how things were done in big business. I saw what qualities were part of being senior management. By and large, ethical behaviour and honesty were sacrosanct. Nowadays, it seems to be a case of "spin any yarn you can think of and see if the politically correct audience will suck it in" — or whether a pesky journalist smells a rat. "The CEO Exit Myth" (Editor’s Note, February 6-12), on Tiger Brands, is a perfect example of such corporate bulldust. Companies would get away with this if it weren’t for people like yourselves. The business world should be ashamed of itself. Tony BallGillitts
