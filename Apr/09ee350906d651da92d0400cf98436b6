After hearing that I qualify for a payment holiday on my bond, due to it being up to date, I immediately applied. However, my personal banker seemed unaware of this new "product" the bank was offering. After I shared the link to an article, my banker said they would consider my application — however, it could take a couple of months. Now, I want to ask: are the banks really offering payment holidays? Or is this a method to play the role of good Samaritan while having no intention of being one? Or is it a ploy by the banks to improve their books (because they know there are going to be mass defaults)? By giving someone a payment holiday, the debtor will effectively be up to date and in good standing even after three months of nonpayment — in other words, no write-downs. The process reminds me of an election that seems free and fair, but the number of polling stations in the opposition strongholds are reduced from 1,000 to two. Because of the long queues, people give up and don’t vote. Afterwards, the country celebrates the ruling party’s good stewardship, and how it acted in the best interest of its people. #NoSuchThingAsAFreeLunch Name withheldJoburg The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
