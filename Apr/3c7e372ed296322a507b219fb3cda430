I believe all this rapture over President Cyril Ramaphosa’s dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak is premature. In his televised address, Ramaphosa assured businesses that they would be able to receive relief — quite stirring, feel-good stuff. And then the cameras were switched off and the lights dimmed. Within days I received a circular from the National Employers Association of SA in which its CEO, Gerhard Papenfus, bemoans the difficulties facing stressed businesses applying for relief [from the government]. Actually, nothing has changed. Politicians spout all sorts of promises, but rarely do these translate into any action — the Compensation Fund, state-owned enterprises, the Unemployment Insurance Fund … the list is endless. And yet people still vote for them. I am incredulous. Tony BallGillitts The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
