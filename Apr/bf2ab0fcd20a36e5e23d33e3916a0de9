As you’ll have noticed so far in the coronavirus lockdown, there’s a lot to read out there — good and bad. But our mission at the Financial Mail has always been slightly different: to bring you the intelligence behind the news — usable information that clarifies, not confuses. Every day, our editors will sift through the churning ocean of stories throughout the world to flag the three best, must-read articles of the previous 24 hours. We’ll also bring you exclusive news and analysis about SA’s response to the outbreak from Katharine Child, one of the country’s top health reporters. If there’s a story out there you’ve heard about, she’ll be able to tell you how true it is, and what it means for you. Our award-winning graphics team — Vuyo Singiswa and Shaun Uthum — will also create new daily graphs, and find the best pictures of a world in lockdown.
