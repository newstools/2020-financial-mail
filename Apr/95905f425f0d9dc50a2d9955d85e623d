Henley Business School Africa is offering all its virtual education insights, learning, innovations and methods free to SA universities and business schools. The decision, part of the Joburg-based school’s efforts to provide access to education during the Covid-19 pandemic, was put in place before the national lockdown, says dean Jon Foster-Pedley. Henley’s own education programmes, including the MBA, have all continued but he says educational institutions must do more than manage their own interests. The school is preparing its knowledge and teaching methods for life after lockdown. "But we want to share [them] with the rest of the country to build national capacity," he says. "This is not about us having a competitive advantage as a business school but rather helping other institutions continue and evolve their teaching during this time to be in the best shape to recover after the crisis. We will be running workshops on Zoom to share our knowledge with both public and private educators." SA life and education will be changed forever once Covid-19 is gone, he says. "We are now in the realm of the unknown, which is shaping and informing what will be the new normal when we overcome this pandemic. We have to be ready for that change and commit the education sector to rebuilding the economy, creating jobs and prosperity." He adds that education, especially business leadership education, will be absolutely critical to this, which is why the process can’t wait until the lockdown is lifted.
