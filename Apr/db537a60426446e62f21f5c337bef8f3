It was only a matter of time before SA was affected by the coronavirus outbreak (Covid-19). Now, as a country, we need to pull together to defeat it — as we did when SA was being devastated by HIV/Aids. It’s not disputed that SA administered one of the biggest HIV/Aids programmes in the world. It resulted in life expectancy increasing from the 40s to 65 — a significant and remarkable achievement. The leadership demonstrated by President Cyril Ramaphosa and all spheres of government during the Covid-19 outbreak must be supported and applauded. For the first time, we have put aside our political differences for the sake of SA. This should be viewed as the beginning of good things to come — that political parties can rekindle and invoke the spirit of great leaders such as Nelson Mandela to put the country first instead of political grandstanding. Business, churches, NGOs and civil society should now also work together to defeat this pandemic. With all hands on deck, we can fight and defeat Covid-19.
