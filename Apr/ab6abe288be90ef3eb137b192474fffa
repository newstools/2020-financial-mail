During the coronavirus lockdown, we have not been able to print the Financial Mail magazine every week â€“ but, from Thursday April 30, it is back in stores and being delivered to subscribers across SA (some areas in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng may only receive copies over the weekend). In the meantime, our subscribers can still read the full edition online: the Financial Mail e-edition, an exact replica of the print magazine, delivered via a service called PressReader. You'll be asked to sign in (or subscribe if you haven't yet done so) when you click on the Financial Mail cover image on the page. Articles from the magazine are still published digitally on the Financial Mail website too, of course. We still have a great lockdown subscription offer for you: pay just R60 for 60 days' full access to BusinessLIVE, which includes Business Day and Financial Mail. If you missed our previous editions since the start of the lockdown in SA, you'll find them here:
