Last week, for the first time, we celebrated our Freedom Day under lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The muted celebration should be viewed within the context of us, as the nation, being called to sacrifice our freedom for the greater benefit of our health. This year, Freedom Day was marked by the arrival of the Cuban Medical Brigade. That country is a true friend of SA, Africa and the world when it comes to health and humanitarian issues. Given that the Cuban contingent is made up of doctors, I think it’s appropriate that we celebrate our freedom by paying tribute and appreciation to all those on the frontline in the fight against Covid-19. The journey ahead is still full of hurdles, as we are also fighting the triple challenge of inequality, unemployment and poverty. The pandemic has shown that so much still needs to be done by our government to ensure the people enjoy the fruits of freedom. Nelson Mandela said: "Overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice." Those words must resonate with us as we fight these challenges.
