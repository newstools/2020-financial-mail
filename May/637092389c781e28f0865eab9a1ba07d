So Virgin Atlantic offers a superb service to the consumer, Jamie Carr (Fox, April 30-May 6)? Not to this one. Once was enough. Surly cabin staff, forgettable food, dubious wine sloshed from carafes into plastic cups, no refills. For me, the ultimate bit of tackiness was that certain seats in economy had purple cushions. Other than that, they were indistinguishable from the other seats. But we were repeatedly warned that if we moved to a purple seat we would be charged a pound, collected by the cabin staff. A whole pound? Try to imagine the minions of a multibillionaire collecting a pound from passengers who sat in an otherwise empty seat to ease the discomfort in a three-seat row. The pettiness still astounds me, five years later. Prof Peter SurteesNapier The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent toÂ fmmail@fm.co.za
