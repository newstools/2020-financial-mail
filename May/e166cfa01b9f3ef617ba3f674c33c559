Two SA business schools and a bank have won an international award for executive education. Henley Business School Africa, the Gordon Institute of Business Science (Gibs) and Standard Bank are the first African team to win the Practice Gold Award from the European Foundation for Management Development. Based in Brussels, the foundation is a global accreditation body for business schools, corporate universities and programmes. It has 900 member organisations in 91 countries. Henley, Gibs and Standard Bank won for a programme called #UnTAP. Created in 2017, it brought together 328 Standard Bank executives from 20 African countries for a three-month transformational executive management programme. Standard Bank’s group head of human capital, Sharon Taylor, says the programme offered executives "rich personal and professional development experiences that prepare our leaders for success in an ever-changing environment". Henley executive education director Linda Buckley says the co-designed programme was a first for SA. Gill Cross, head of learning innovation at Gibs, adds: "The partnership cultivated a rich approach towards the design and delivery of leadership development solutions ‘by Africa, for Africa’."
