1. Chips, it’s Trump The US has cut off Huawei’s access to vital computer chips, striking what could be a crippling blow to the Chinese tech giant. Fresh sanctions that restrict foreign semiconductor companies from selling chips developed or produced using US software or technology to Huawei, without first obtaining a licence to do so, were unveiled this week. Huawei relies on foreign-made semiconductors to power its 5G infrastructure. The move is the latest from the Trump administration in a war against Beijing for control of future technologies. 2. Angola shows the way The son of Angola’s former president José Eduardo dos Santos has been jailed for five years for fraud committed when he was head of the country’s sovereign wealth fund. Angola says José Filomeno dos Santos embezzled up to $1.5bn while overseeing the $5bn fund from 2013 to 2018. He was charged with stealing $500m from the fund and transferring it to a bank account in Switzerland. He is the first member of the former presidential family to be prosecuted as part of an anti-corruption campaign led by President Joao Lourenço. The state is also targeting his sister Isabel for alleged embezzlement while she ran the state oil firm Sonangol. 3. Not sorry enough Namibian President Hage Geingob has turned down Germany’s offer of $11.7m in reparations for the genocide committed by the German empire at the start of the 20th century. Geingob also objected to Germany’s use of the term "healing the wounds" in place of the word reparations, saying the terminology would also require discussion. The two countries began negotiating an agreement in 2015 that would involve Germany offering an official apology and providing development aid as compensation for the killing of tens of thousands of Herero and Nama people by German occupiers from 1904 to 1908.
