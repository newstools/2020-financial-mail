In my view, and bearing in mind his past, President Cyril Ramaphosa is a decent and honourable man. In another place and with proper support he could be an acceptable voice of reason on the world stage among leaders who seem to have gone mad. But it is impossible to survive in a cesspool. What I would like to know — as would most South Africans — is whether anyone in the ANC actually does an overall common-sense check of lockdown regulations, considering the nonsense of some of them. In trying to understand the ANC’s decision-making process and where real influence lies, I first thought of the taxi associations, which were very kindly treated once they had shown their muscle. Then I thought of the new school closures and the idle teacher unions, which have had some success in jerking the government around. Then I realised that I also had to consider the illicit tobacco trade, which, if information is to be believed, may benefit some in the ANC. But when I thought that perhaps Alcoholics Anonymous may have been responsible for the liquor ban, I realised that the permutations are endless — and I suddenly remembered the old joke about which part of the body controls the brain. Maybe the answer to where real influence lies in the ANC is "all of the above". Perhaps, somewhere out there, there’s a "deep throat" who will tell the nation what really goes on in "the collective".
