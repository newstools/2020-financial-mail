The nation has moved to lockdown level 2 — but we dare not lower our guard against a viral assassin whose reach seems limitless. The threat will continue to lurk across SA, and will probably come in a second wave to harvest what it could not gather in its first sweep. As the economy is opened up and restrictions on movements are relaxed, the risk of transmission will intensify. Aerosol transmission becomes a potent factor if we don’t adhere to social distancing. Those who recklessly flout public health warnings and social distancing protocols will pay dearly for their folly. Some of our citizens are on the verge of dismantling every hard-fought milestone achieved in our nation’s struggle against Covid-19 as they emerge from enforced isolation, taking to the streets in a resurgence of shopping and other group activities. A second wave of the virus will be devastating for SA. An epic battle will be lost because of our complacency. Farouk AraieJoburg The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
