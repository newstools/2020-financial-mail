How convenient for SA Breweries (SAB) and Heineken to economically blackmail SA with the loss of multibillion-rand investments due to the ban on alcohol sales. As much as I should be loyal to SAB — my late father was a truck driver for the company — it has a reputation for playing the victim when things aren’t working in its favour. Distell is also suffering from the short-sighted fascism of the current political administration. But you don’t see Distell pushing its froth to remind SA that it is feeding families. What bumptious, naive arrogance. Luyanda Marlon KamaKwa-Dwesi, Port Elizabeth The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
