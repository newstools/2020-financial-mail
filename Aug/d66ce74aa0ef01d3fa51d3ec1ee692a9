While everyone in a constitutional democracy is entitled to express their views on issues we face as a country, the idea that Eskom had ample time to conduct all necessary maintenance is grossly mistaken (Letters, August 13-19). On a normal basis, we experience peak consumption during the times when we are about to leave for work or are at home after work. Office usage somehow balances out in the consumption curve. The lockdown only removed the intensity of usage from the manufacturing and mining (heavy industry) users. Further, the lockdown increased residential consumption, as many people were working from home. In light of this, Eskom still faced similar challenges, as it ensured that we never had any real load-shedding during levels 4 and 5. As the public, it’s easy for us to view Eskom as a monster run by incompetent individuals. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are just as responsible for the challenges at the utility. A case in point is the proliferation of illegal connections, and the cavalier attitude of consumers in upmarket residential areas. Without divorcing Eskom from a history of malfeasance and corruption, we need to move forward and solve the problems once and for all. The survival of Eskom requires a collective effort. As users, we need to change our attitudes towards energy. The government can keep building power stations — to the detriment of the environment — but until there’s behavioural change, nothing will change.
