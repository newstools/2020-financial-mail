I note that one of the perks of being a member of the KwaZulu-Natal legislature, which Zandile Gumede will now enjoy while out on bail, is 24 free flights. Now, I presume these are return flights on SAA, perhaps to anywhere. If you add up the numbers of all those who enjoy this perk — members of other provincial legislatures and parliament, directors-general and other senior civil servants, traditional leaders, no doubt the hoi polloi of the ANC, SACP and Cosatu and the like — you arrive at a significant number and cost. And nothing is worse than a perk that cannot be used, and so a backlog must be building up. It’s no wonder SAA has to be resurrected — at any cost, it seems.
