It is not a far-fetched possibility that cabinet could have reviewed its stance on the ban on alcohol sales in terms of the severity of the circumstances. However, the arrogance and holier-than-thou attitude displayed by SA Breweries, Heineken, FM editor Rob Rose and former Shoprite CEO Whitey Basson et al in engaging the government through the media, and with not-so-subtle threats, may have affected the dynamics of the saga. Singling out one member of a collective — in this case the co-operative governance & traditional affairs minister — as being a bad apple does nothing but embarrass the collective. Similarly, no amount of praise-singing for President Cyril Ramaphosa will sway the collective. Decisions are made by the collective, not the individual. The sooner this is understood, the better for all concerned. Richard MahupeteEmalahleni The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
