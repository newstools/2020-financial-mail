I have been a good customer, in good standing with Eskom since 1987, when I got an Eskom supply on my farm. I am now a prepaid customer in a small settlement on the coast, and this is still the case. Why then do I, along with a few other pensioners, have to endure these outages? Does the saving from a few fridges and TVs really make a difference to the load on the grid? I venture to say that a much bigger and more meaningful saving for Eskom would be to switch off nonpaying customers and then users in heavy-load areas. Apart from sending a twofold message to the nonpayers, it would also remove a security hazard to old people who do not have lights in the evening. Of course the best solution would be to cut off power to all nonpayers — as mine would have been cut off had I skipped just one payment — but that is a debate for another day.
