Robert Stone from Linden (Letters, March 12-18) sums up what I’ve been saying to people for years. Government employees genuinely think that the tax on their salaries is their contribution to the fiscus. They are blissfully unaware that real income tax in the form of pay-as-you-earn comes from nongovernment sources — private people and corporates — and that it is from there that civil servants can be paid. Like Stone, I would like an answer from senior finance people: why do we need ministers and deputy ministers? First, they are mere figureheads who in most cases have very little idea of their portfolios and regularly keep us amused with their gaffes. Second, they come with spokespeople, security details and, it has to be said, some overblown egos. Finally, they are regularly shuffled from portfolio to portfolio, depending on which president they are aligned with, and they often interfere in the work of their directors-general. On the other hand, directors-general of departments have five-year contracts and, thanks to some longevity, have some continuity in their posts. Imagine how we could trim the government bill if we slashed the number of ministers and MPs. Tony BallGillitts The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
