There is one aspect of your excellent articles on the SA Revenue Service (Sars) and tax generally (Cover Story and On My Mind, March 5-March 11) that I do not understand. To simplify, my employer — a company in the private sector — trades, makes a profit and pays tax on that profit. It also pays VAT and may pay other amounts to the fiscus. That company also pays me and I pay personal income tax and VAT. Across the whole productive private sector, my employer’s and my taxes finance the public sector, the government. Call this private sector contribution Pool A. A government employee is paid using the tax of Pool A and in turn pays income tax and VAT — Pool B. For purposes of calculating the total tax paid to government, the funds of pools A and B are aggregated without differentiation by Sars. But, in fact, the tax in Pool B is merely a reallocation of funds from Pool A, and is thus double-accounted. Could someone (perhaps finance minister Tito Mboweni, Sars commissioner Edward Kieswetter or judge Dennis Davis) please explain where my thinking is incorrect?
