In “Time for Fearless Leadership” (Letters, March 12-18), Mafika Siphiwe Mgcina, of the ANC’s Sedibeng task team (writing in his personal capacity), shows he is willing to nail his principles to the mast. Such independent thinking gives us a glimmer of hope because he and hopefully others are breaking with the past and acting independently of Luthuli House. A group of fresh thinkers in the party might save SA from the disastrous policies being touted — expropriation without compensation, National Health Insurance and prescribed assets, for example. The ANC has failed SA in many respects. It betrayed the Freedom Charter and trampled on the dreams of those yearning for a better life by turning a blind eye to incompetent management and huge corruption. As a result of the ANC’s socialist thinking, the free-market system that lifted SA’s manufacturing and finance sectors was undone, leading to hesitancy among foreign investors, increased unemployment and spiralling debt. Mgcina raises hopes of a change in the ruling party’s attitude, which may give impetus to progressive ideas such as using merit as the yardstick when employing talent. Change is vital — without it we will continue limping to eventual collapse. Ted O’ConnorAlbertskroon The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
