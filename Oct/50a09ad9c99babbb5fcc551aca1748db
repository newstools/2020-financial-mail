As anyone with a postbox will attest, the renewal notices have already been inserted — and must be paid by January 31. It is ironic how staggeringly efficient the post office has been with getting the renewals out, while failing to carry out its core business. In addition to the dearth of delivered mail, the costs of postbox rental have jumped significantly, and the pensioners’ discount has been cancelled. Given the abominable service we get, I wonder if the post office can guarantee that it will be in business for the duration of 2021 — otherwise our rental costs will disappear in the ANC looting trough, like every other state-owned entity.
