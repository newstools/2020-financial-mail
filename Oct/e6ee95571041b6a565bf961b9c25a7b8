Few would argue that SA is a fraudster’s paradise, with con artists becoming ever more sophisticated at scamming unwary citizens. It was no surprise then that a group of "activists" from a collective (another word for a gang) calling themselves #WeSeeYou rented a house on Airbnb and then simply refused to move out after the rental period ended (Features, October 8-14). They released a long and garbled statement about the aims of their "occupation", but essentially they were a bunch of chancers committing a crime — no different to those who loot the public purse every day. Whatever their motives, the fact is that they fraudulently occupied another person’s property, causing the innocent victim to lose rental income. Apparently this is acceptable because he is "rich" and they are not (or so they would have us believe). Isn’t that how all criminals rationalise their actions? The fact that property owners and people like myself pay millions in taxes to a government that is tasked with using that revenue to address issues of homelessness puts the lie to their motives. Trying to justify it by abusing the queer tag is both dishonest and distasteful. What’s more concerning is that your columnist, Chris Roper, chooses to overlook the obvious illegality of their action, and the potential for further occupations, which are bound to cause violence. To define it as "performance art" is disappointing, to say the least. Mitch LaunspachMonument, Krugersdorp The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
