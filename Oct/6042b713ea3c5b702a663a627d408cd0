On the farce that is Heritage Day, no mention was made by the media or any politician of the fact that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the arrival of the British settlers in Algoa Bay. HE Hockly in his history, The Story of the British Settlers of 1820 in SA relates that 21 ships arrived between April 9 and late June of 1820. This should have been an event to be commemorated and celebrated. However, in the current political environment it was ignored — no doubt because it is not politically correct to remember it. Your generally good publication was remiss in not running a feature on this event. In my view it is shameful for a leading English-language publication to have simply ignored this milestone. Since the year is not yet over, perhaps you could find a historian to write a short account of the event, to inform young readers in particular. This would be more constructive than President Cyril Ramaphosa’s rant about racist statues. AD WilsonParktown The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
